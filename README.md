Introduction
------------

This package contains the [Correlates of State Policy](http://ippsr.msu.edu/public-policy/correlates-state-policy) dataset, which

> ... includes more than seven-hundred variables, with observations across the U.S. 50 &gt; states and time (1900 â€“ 2016). These variables represent policy outputs or &gt; political, social, or economic factors that may influence policy differences &gt; across the states. The codebook includes the variable name, a short description &gt; of the variable, the variable time frame, a longer description of the variable, &gt; and the variable source(s) and notes.

See website above for suggested citation.

The package allows the user to load and work with the dataset using the R programming language. Crucially, it incorporates the entire codebook into the dataset, which allows for easier filtering, finding units and sources, etc.

Example use
-----------

``` r
library(csp)
library(ggplot2)

data(csp, package = "csp")
dim(csp)
```

    ## [1] 5507541      13

``` r
names(csp)
```

    ##  [1] "year"          "st"            "stateno"       "state"        
    ##  [5] "state_fips"    "state_icpsr"   "variable"      "value"        
    ##  [9] "topic"         "var_desc"      "dates"         "var_long_desc"
    ## [13] "sources_notes"

``` r
csp[1:2, ]
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 13
    ##    year    st stateno  state state_fips state_icpsr      variable value
    ##   <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>  <chr>      <dbl>       <dbl>         <chr> <dbl>
    ## 1  1900    AK       2 Alaska          2          81 pollib_median   NaN
    ## 2  1901    AK       2 Alaska          2          81 pollib_median   NaN
    ## # ... with 5 more variables: topic <chr>, var_desc <chr>, dates <chr>,
    ## #   var_long_desc <chr>, sources_notes <chr>

``` r
df <- subset(csp, variable == "real2_pc_inc_quar")
df$value <- as.numeric(df$value)

ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = value, color = state)) +
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_grey() +
  theme_light() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL,
       title = df$var_desc[1],
       subtitle = df$var_long_desc[1])
```
