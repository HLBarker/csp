## Introduction

This package contains the [Correlates of State
Policy](http://ippsr.msu.edu/public-policy/correlates-state-policy) 
dataset, which

> ... includes more than seven-hundred variables, with observations across the
> U.S. 50 > states and time (1900 â€“ 2016). These variables represent policy
> outputs or > political, social, or economic factors that may influence policy
> differences > across the states. The codebook includes the variable name, a
> short description > of the variable, the variable time frame, a longer
> description of the variable, > and the variable source(s) and notes.

See website above for suggested citation.

The package allows the user to load and work with the dataset using the R 
programming language. Crucially, it incorporates the entire codebook into the
dataset, which allows for easier filtering, finding units and sources, etc.

## Example use

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(csp)
library(ggplot2)

data(csp, package = "csp")
dim(csp)
names(csp)
csp[1:2, ]
```

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df <- subset(csp, variable == "real2_pc_inc_quar")
df$value <- as.numeric(df$value)

ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = value, color = state)) +
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_grey() +
  theme_light() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL,
       title = df$var_desc[1],
       subtitle = df$var_long_desc[1])
```
